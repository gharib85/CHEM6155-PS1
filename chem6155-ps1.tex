\maketitle

\section{Mathematical Foundations}
The following problems are roughly aligned with the indicated chapters of Steiner, The Chemistry
Maths Book, 2nd Edition, Oxford University Press 2008. If you have difficulty with any
of these problems, please read the corresponding chapter. If that is not sufficient
to help you solve it, please contact one of the module instructors for help. Some of the problems
require you to use \emph{Mathematica}, which is available to Students from the University. 
Install a copy of it on your computer. To get started, there are many tutorials and videos
available online.

\paragraph{1.1 Functions, Differentiation, and Integration}
\begin{enumerate}
 	\item Define the following properties of functions $y=f(x)$, and provide an example for each. You
	may have to look up the definitions; if so, provide the source.
	  \begin{itemize}
	  	\item monotonous
		\item bounded
		\item divergent
		\item continuous
		\item differentiable
		\item periodic
	  \end{itemize}
	  
	 \item Indicate which of the above properties the following functions satisfy (state
	 your reasoning):
	 	\begin{itemize}
			\item $f(x)=x^2\,e^{-x}$
			\item $f(x)=\tan(1/x)$
			\item $f(x)=\cos\frac{2\pi x}{L} + 2 \sin\frac{6\pi x}{L}$
			\item $f(x) = x^3-4x^2-11x+30$
			\item $f(x) = \dfrac{x^3-4x^2-11x+30}{x^3-6}$
		\end{itemize}
		
	\item Plot the above functions using \emph{Mathematica}. Indicate roots, stationary points
	and poles in the plots.
	 
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{1.3 Vectors and Vector Fields}

\paragraph{1.4 Matrices and Eigenvalue Problems}

\section{Isotopes and Natural Abundances}
\paragraph{Isotopomers of Ethanol}
	Ethanol (\chemfig{CH_3CH_2OH}) consists of the elements carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen.
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item How many distinct stable (non-radioactive) isotopomers of ethanol exist? 
	\item Create a table of all hydrogen isotopomers of ethanol, and indicate 
	their natural abundance to two significant figures. Are any of these chiral?
	\item How would the numbers in the above table change if the natural abundance
	of deuterium were 50\% instead of 0.015\%?
	\end{enumerate}
